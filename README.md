# Project Description

I have created an app called Olive Skin, which is a skincare ecommerce app. With this app a user can got to the site and see a home page with a carousel of photos and a list of products beneath. A user may also go to the Products page and see a list of all the products as well. If the user clicks on the buy now button they will be brought to the products show page where they will see a description of the product and a button that says "Add to cart" or "Go to Cart". The cart function is currently not available. If the user clicks on the reviews tab on the navbar they will see a list of reviews for the Olive Skin brand and if they scroll to the bottom of the page they will be able to leave a review themselves."
